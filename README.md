# Homework_04
Timed coding quiz. Ultimately this required two pages of HTML (index and scores), a little Bootstrap, some @media screen calls in a secondary style sheet, and a few hundre lines of javascript in between the external script.js file, and some score table specific lines dropped into the scores.html page itself. "Decent" responsiveness and styling, in the sense that one will be able to maintain functionality at various screen sizes, but it could use further refinement stylistically.

## Difficulties
Next time, I will write down pseudo-code as first draft, rather than jumping straight to pseudo-code in commenting. I think having it on scren as comments was really helpful, but I also think I would have benefitted from WRITING DOWN AN EXAMPLE OF THE SYNTAX FOR KEY OPERATIONS AND HAVING IT ON HAND, as much of the time spent on this came from a lack of familiarity with syntax, and DOM elements. 

## Remember to
Come back to this file to refresh brain on proper .js syntax formatting for a wide variety of functions. Also, not a bad point of reference for scope, and in particular with how it can confuse global/local variables.
