## Project Description
Timed coding quiz. Ultimately this required two HTML pages (index, scores), Bootstrap, some @media screen calls in a secondary style sheet, and a few hundred lines of javascript in between the external script.js file, and some score table specific lines dropped into the scores.html page itself. "Decent" responsiveness and styling, in the sense that one will be able to maintain functionality at various screen sizes, but it could use further refinement stylistically.

## Function

This quiz features six questions, reduces the clock by 10 seconds when you miss a question, and prompts the player for their scores and initials, which are saved to the Scores (scores.html) page. On the High Scores page, funtionality exists for returning to the quiz and clearing all scores.

## Difficulties

Next time, I will write down pseudo-code as a first draft, rather than jumping straight to pseudo-code in commenting. I think having it on scren as comments was really helpful, but I also think I would have benefitted from preparing syntax reference examples for some of my intended functionks, as much of the time spent on this came from a lack of familiarity with syntax, and DOM elements. Additionally, struggled with scope problems due to a lack of familiarity, but have a better understanding of that afterwards.

## Remember to

Come back to this file to refresh brain on working .js syntax formatting for a wide variety of functions. Also, not a bad point of reference for scope, and in particular with how it can confuse global/local variables.
